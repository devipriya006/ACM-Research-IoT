Explanation: Simulating Data and Sending to ThingSpeak

Simulated Data Generation

To simulate sensor data, we generate random values within a defined range:

Temperature: Random value between 20°C and 35°C

Humidity: Random value between 30% and 70%

This is done using Python's random.uniform() function, which ensures realistic variations in the data.

Sending Data to ThingSpeak

The generated data is sent to ThingSpeak using HTTP GET requests with the API key and data fields as parameters. The request is structured as:

response = requests.get(URL, params={
    "api_key": API_KEY,
    "field1": temperature,
    "field2": humidity
})

ThingSpeak processes this request and stores the data in the assigned channel.

Data Visualization

ThingSpeak provides built-in visualization tools to graph the incoming data in real time. The channel's public/private link allows users to view the data updates as they are received.
